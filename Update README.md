#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

This is the developing applications,programs and systems using programming languages and frameworks.
On the importance; It creates Reliable software, Saves time and money , improves security, boosts innovation.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Mastering complexity
Mastering process
Mastering machine

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

 Planning - identify the software requirement or purpose and scope.
 Requirement analysis - identify the final user specification. 
Design - building the framework. 
Coding - converting software design into tangible code.
 Testing - examine the software for any bugs and glitches

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

   Waterfall methodology - Linear and sequential, each phase is completed before moving on.
 - Testing is done at the end of the development process

Agile methodology - Iterative and incremental, with multiple cycles (sprints). 
-  Regular customer feedback is incorporated into every sprint. 


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer - developing applications,programs and systems using programming languages and frameworks.
 - Mintaining and updating software to keep it functional. 

Quality Assurance Engineer - collaborate with stakeholders to understand and clarify software requirement.
- Confirm that the software meets the requirement before deployment.

Project Manager - assembles and lead the software development team.
- Deliver the complete software to the client and regularly check its performance.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

. An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software platform that facilitates the creation of other software applications by providing a space to write, compile, and debug code, sometimes with value-adding tools that reduce development efforts. eg Visual Studio Code (VSCode)

Imporance;
- An IDE can format the written text by automatically making some words bold or italic, or by using different font colors. These visual cues make the source code more readable and give instant feedback about accidental syntax errors.
an IDE can make suggestions to complete a code statement when the developer begins typing.

. Version Control Systems (VCS) - are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. eg Git

Importance; 
-Error Recovery: Allows reverting to previous versions if new changes introduce errors.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

-Rapid technological advancement places considerable pressure on software engineers to stay current.
Solution;
. By adopting continuous learning practices and using agile methodologies to adapt to emerging trends, keeping their skills sharp in an ever-evolving industry.

- Software Security - Programming secure software is a complex and challenging task.
  Solution;
 . By doing researches on ways to defend against hacking, malware, phishing, insider and third-party threats. 


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

. Unit tests - are close to the source of an application, They consist in testing individual methods and functions of the classes, components, or modules used by your software. - it ensures that each unit performs its intended function correctly, isolated from other components.

. System testing -Focus on the entire software system as a whole, including all functionalities and interactions.
 -It help to verify that the system meets all functional and non-functional requirements, including performance, usability, and security .

 .  Integration tests - verify that different modules or services used by your application work well together.
 - help to ensure data flows smoothly between modules and interfaces work as expected.

. Acceptance tests - are formal tests that verify if a system satisfies business requirements. They require the entire application to be running while testing and focus on replicating user behaviors. 



#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

  Prompt engineering  is the process where you guide generative AI solutions to generate desired outputs.
  Importance; 
  - developer control - Prompt engineering gives developers more control over users' interactions with the AI. Effective prompts provide intent and establish context to the large language models. Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise.
    
 
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Draw a picture of a person
Draw a full-body portrait of a young woman with long brown hair, wearing a red jacket and blue jeans, standing in a park on a sunny day with trees and grass in the background.
Clarity: The improved prompt specifies what is being asked (a full-body portrait) rather than just a "person.
Specific Details: Describing the woman's appearance (long brown hair, red jacket, blue jeans) and the setting (park, sunny day, trees, grass) gives clear guidance on the image to be created.
Concise: The additional details provide a clear picture without being overly complicated, making it easier for the artist to understand exactly what is needed.
